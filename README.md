## Welcome to Dan Wood's github blog.  Thank you for coming!

Spent some time setting up a blog through github.   I can't wait to document the projects that I'm working on.  
Currently, i'm just taking baby steps, going through the new book entitled The Hacker Playbook 3.  I have worked on many other books and challenges before, this is just the beginning of my documentation.
I have many things I want you to know about and I'm very enthusiastic about this new blog.  Stay tuned for more.
