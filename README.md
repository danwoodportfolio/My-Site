### 3.28.19

Spent some time setting up a blog through github.   I can't wait to document the projects that I'm working on.  
Currently, i'm just taking baby steps, going through the new book entitled The Hacker Playbook 3.  I have worked on many other books and challenges before, this is just the beginning of my documentation.
I have many things I want you to know about and I'm very enthusiastic about this new blog.  Stay tuned for more.

### 2.1.20

  Today I worked on a lab that required the usage of Hydra.  It was difficult for me to grasp the syntax for that one security tool.  I plan to go back and sharpen my understanding of it.  The lab required me to use burpsuite and hydra. I didn't learn anything new with burpsuite, i've used it before many times. I'm focusing my energy for this next few weeks exclusively on Website attacks mainly because I want to become proficient in that realm so that I can earn bug bounties.
