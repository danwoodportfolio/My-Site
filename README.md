Spent some time setting up a blog through github.   I can't wait to showcase the projects that I'm working on.  
Currently, i'm just taking baby steps, going through the new book entitled The Hacker Playbook 3.  
I have many things I want you to know about and I'm very enthusiastic about this new blog.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/danwoodportfolio/My-Site/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
